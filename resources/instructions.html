<h1>How to Play Wordle!</h1>
<p>
    Guessing the five lettered word in six tries may be hard for some,
    but not you, player!
</p>
<p>
    After each guess the colour of the letter tiles will change.
    When a tile is green, the letter is in the correct position.
    When a tile is yellow, the letter is present within the word, but not in that position.
    And finally, when a tile is grey, the letter is not present within the secret word.
    Pressing the enter word will allow you to guess the next word.
</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
